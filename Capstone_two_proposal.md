# Capstone 2 Proposal

## Idea Summary
This capstone will be a web-based inventory management system. It will house an inventory of instruments that can be reserved or checked out. This will allow users to plan ahead for their own uses of instruments as well as allow other uses to see that instruments are already reserved or taken.

### Backend 
I think I will have a simple backend to serve a webpage for the main portion of the app as well as an admin dashboard like page. Further routing will then be done using react router.

Along with the simple backend to serve the application, I will have an API developed to interact with the database. This API will also be fully developed for use apart from the web application.

### Frontend
The frontend will be a react application. There will be the ability for the user to login/signup, view the instrument inventory, view the current status of instruments (taken, reserved, available), as well as reserve or check out instruments for themselves.

The admin dashboard will allow admins to view the status of certain instruments as well as add, modify, or remove instruments themselves.


## Tech Stack
This project with be a Node/JavaScript based project.
The backend and associated API will be built in Node/Express. 
The frontend will be a React base.
A calendar library or strategy for creating a good calendar is still up in the air.


### Next Steps
* Figure out Calendar library or plan
* Sketch out database schema
